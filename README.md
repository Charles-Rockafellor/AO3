# Foolproof images, .mp3s, etc.

Resources for AO3 work "Foolproof"; finally made the dive to GitHub after a long story with Pinterest, gifs, mp4s, and agita.  Currently in an Unrevealed Collection, https://archiveofourown.org/works/70899846 reveal is awaiting April Fools' Day 2026.

See https://archiveofourown.org/users/Charles_Rockafellor/collections for all of my writing (I break things down by thematic collection to make finding similar works easier for my readers: I tend toward physics, number theory, RomComs, food, zombies, and a little dash of MilFic, but there's a fair chunk of TTRPG and other stuff in there).
